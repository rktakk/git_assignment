a. What is an issue?

GitHub issues are used to track work, give or receive feedback, collaborate on tasks and communicate with others. 

b. What is a pull request?

A pull request (PR) is a proposal to merge a set of changes from one branch into another. Collaborators can review and discuss the proposed set of changes before they are integrated into the main codebase. 

c. How do I open up a pull request?

- Fork the repository and create a branch 
- Within the branch update the file and commit the changes
- On the ribbon select Pull Requests and create a New Pull Request
- Compare the changes from the branch to the main base

d. Give me a step by step guide on how to add someone to your repository.

- Ask for their user name
- On GitHub.com, navigate to the repository
- Under the repository name, click settings
- In the Access section of the sidebar, select Collaborators
- Click Add People
- In the search field input the user name or start typing until you get a match
- Click Add NAME to REPOSITORY 
- The user will receive an email inviting them to the repository. The invitation will need to be accepted to have access to the repository. 

e. What is the difference between git and GitHub?

Git is the version control system that manages changes to the source code. GitHub is the web-based platform that hosts Git repositories and provides collaboration tools for teams. 

f. What does git diff do?

Git diff visually describes what was added or removed from a file since its last commit. 

g. What is the main branch?

The main branch is the primary branch of a repository. This branch usually holds the latest stable version of code and serves as the base for collaboration. 

h. Besides our initial commit if it is a new repository, should we directly push our changes directly into the main branch?

No, changes should not be directly pulled into the main branch. Instead, they should be pushed to feature branches and then merged into the main branch. This way changes can be isolated, reviewed, peers can provide feedback. This method also allows for changes to be rolled back in case they are required.
